# Plotly_Bacterial_Biodiversity

# Introduction
Roza is trying to reach her audience by making her plots dinamic, her experiment is about bacteria that is able to synthesis proteins that taste like beef, the funny part
is that the bacterias that she is studying is inside our belly button, she studied a total of 154 individuals and grew the bacteria that lives in the belly button assigning
them a serial number and wants to be able to show it to the public.

# Objective 
Be able to create a webpage to display Roza data and make it user friendly with 3 different type of charts.

# Material 
- Javascript
- D3
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Plotly

# Results 
I was able to create a webpage with colors and different charts, the first one was the bar chart, after that a bubble and gauge chart, after looking into some random 
subjects we can say that there was no relation between the frequency of cleaning the belly button and the size and number of bacteria living in them, sometimes they wash
it 7 times a week and still got numbers of 380 bacterias in one cultive.
